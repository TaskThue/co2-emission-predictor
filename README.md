# 🌍 CO₂ Emission Predictor — SDG 13: Climate Action

### 🔍 Overview
This project supports **UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action)** by predicting **CO₂ emissions** based on **GDP and energy consumption** data using a **supervised learning (Linear Regression)** approach.

---

### 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Dataset Creation:** Sample data of 10 African countries with GDP, energy, and emission values.
2. **Model Used:** Linear Regression (`scikit-learn`)
3. **Evaluation:**  
   - R² Score: ~0.92  
   - MAE: ~3.1  
4. **Output:** Predicts CO₂ emissions for given GDP & energy levels.

### 🌱 Ethical Reflection
This model emphasizes sustainable decision-making by quantifying emission trends.
However, it may reflect **data bias** due to uneven data reporting between countries.
Future improvements will use real datasets from the **World Bank** or **UN SDG Data Portal**.
